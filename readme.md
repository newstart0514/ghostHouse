# Three.js Journey
This is my first demo project in the basic stage of learning threejs🥰. It automatically uses GitHub Action to automatically CI/CD deploy and release🛠. Please give me more advice.
> 🚧Attention: In order to display normal effects on GitHub Page⚡, I use CDN service for texture loading. If you are unable to access it, please switch your network🌐. If it is still inaccessible, please submit an issue🤗

## Code Run 💻
``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
